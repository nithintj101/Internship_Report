@article{Allen2009,
abstract = {Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures(1). But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain(1-3), complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming(4-8). Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions(9-11). Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO2), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5-95{\%} confidence interval of 1.3-3.9 degrees C.},

@article{Fasihi2019,
abstract = {CO 2 direct air capture (DAC) has been increasingly discussed as a climate change mitigation option. Despite technical advances in the past decade, there are still misconceptions about DAC's current and long-term costs as well as energy, water and area demands. This could undermine DAC's anticipated role in a neutral or negative greenhouse gas emission energy system, and influence policy makers. In this study, a literature review and techno-economic analyses of state-of-the-art DAC technologies are performed, wherein, DAC technologies are categorised as high temperature aqueous solutions (HT DAC) and low temperature solid sorbent (LT DAC) systems, from an energy system perspective. DAC capital expenditures, energy demands and costs have been estimated under two scenarios for DAC capacities and financial learning rates in the period 2020 to 2050. DAC system costs could be lowered significantly with commercialisation in the 2020s followed by massive implementation in the 2040s and 2050s, making them cost competitive with point source carbon capture and an affordable climate change mitigation solution. It is concluded that LT DAC systems are favourable due to lower heat supply costs and the possibility of using waste heat from other systems. CO 2 capture costs of LT DAC systems powered by hybrid PV-Wind-battery systems for Moroccan conditions and based on a conservative scenario, without/with utilisation of free waste heat are calculated at 222/133, 105/60, 69/40 and 54/32 €/t CO2 in 2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050, respectively. These new findings could enhance DAC's role in a successful climate change mitigation strategy.},

abstract = {This master thesis analyses and proposes a design for a direct air capture (DAC) unit as part of a small scale, solar powered methanol synthesis plant. This project analyses the existing process and design by ZEF BV and explores solutions for mass manufacturing a direct air capture unit. As a result a concept design solution is found and analyzed on cost and environmental impact. To achieve this, several product design methods have been applied, including idea generation and prototyping, all in an iterative process. Sub-solutions have been designed an tested and are brought together in a system architecture to form a product. A direct air capture unit provides an access point to capture CO2 and water from air and turn air into methanol with the power of sunlight. A viable product design can be achieved by integrating product functions in single components rather than making components fulfill a single function. In this way, resources can be used effectively. This thesis shows that it is possible to make such a product, however, many aspects leave room for improvement or may need to change depending on other the needs of other systems of a small scale methanol synthesis plant. It provides a base for a next generation of DAC design.},

@phdthesis{Ovaa2019,
abstract = {Zero Emission Fuels(ZEF) is designing a micro plant which is able to produce methanol from solar energy and air. This research focuses on capturing CO2 and H2O from the air which are needed in post processes. In the absorber CO2 and H2O are absorbed from air. In the desorber these molecules are desorbed from the amine. PEI and TEPA are chosen as the amines. Desorption is the inverse of absorption. CO2 is captured in two ways, either through carbamate or bicarbonate. The formation of bicarbonate is negligible during low CO2 partial pressures. Two functional groups are needed to capture one CO2 molecule. The presence of H2O increases the capture capacity of CO2, and prevents amine degradation. Furthermore, H2O is needed in the electrolyser and therefore, different from industrial DAC, H2O is also a desired desorption product. The expected absorption capacity of H2O and CO2 is equal to 23 and 1.5 [mol / kg amine]. A VLE experiment is done to find the equilibrium between CO2 and H2O in the gas phase and liquid phase. The experiment done with a 30 wt{\%} H2O loading, failed due to a high viscosity after which the solution was not homogeneously mixed. Increasing the H2O loading up to 70 wt{\%} solves the problem. Using two isotherms, at 80 and 120 °C the heat of absorption is calculated using the Clausius Clapeyron equation. The results is a heat of absorption of -73.6 and -68.2 [kJ/mol CO2] for TEPA and PEI, respectively. To find the total desorption of CO2 and H2O in the expected absorption region. A desorption experimental setup is built, experiments are performed at three pressures(50 100 and 200 mbar) and increasing temperatures steps(80,90,100,110,120 °C). The maximum output is equal to 0.9 [mol CO2/ kg amine] using TEPA. The CO2 output of TEPA is twice as high as the output of PEI. Using the experimental data from both tests, an energy model is made find the energy penalty of the desorption component. A two stage flash vessel is designed to reduce the energy penalty, 12.7 [MJ/ kg CO2] is the results. Using a pinch analysis, 82 [W] of the total 128 [W] can be retrieved by heat integration. Therefore, the energy demand of the system is equal to 4.8 [MJ/ kg CO2].},

abstract = {CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is increasing leading to global warming and thus, climate change. Moreover, current renewable technologies such as wind or solar energy only cover the electricity market. A big part of the global energy market is still based on fossil fuels and difficult to electrify. Hence, there is an urgent need to produce renewable liquid hydrocarbons to replace fossil fuels. Zero Emission Fuels (ZEF) is a start-up that aims to develop a small-scale chemical plant to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air into methanol (MeOH) using photovoltaic energy. In this work, the absorption of CO2 using bulk polyamines was characterized experimentally, as well as through numerical modelling. In addition to this, guidelines for the design of the absorber, part of the Direct Air Capture (DAC) unit of ZEF's micro-plant, are given. The focus of the study is placed on the kinetics and loading of CO2. To be able to model the absorption process an experimental approach has been developed regarding the uptake of CO2 and H2O. Firstly, pure H2O absorption experiments were performed in a climate chamber in order to obtain the H2O loadings using polyamines for different H2O content in the air. Secondly, air capture experiments were performed at lab conditions in order to obtain both H2O and CO2 loadings for different process conditions. Thirdly, constants relevant for the modelling part (reaction rate constant and Henry constant) were obtained experimentally. An absorption model, developed in MATLAB, was used to estimate the diffusion coefficient of both H2O and CO2 using the experimental H2O and CO2 loadings. Two main conclusions are obtained from the absorption model of CO2: the absorption of CO2 on polyamines is diffusion-limited and the diffusion coefficient of CO2 is two orders of magnitude lower than the diffusion coefficient of H2O. Based on the fact that the CO2 absorption process is diffusion-limited the mixing patterns should be introduced in the design of the continuous absorber. However, due to the fact that viscosity could influence the flowing behaviour of polyamines, more research is needed.},
